My giant repo o' random hacks.

Started off as your regular ~/bin dump – with two Finger implementations and a
web server written in PHP. Later got pushed over to ~/code, to make place for
the horde of overgrown aliases that have since taken over ~/bin (which I didn't
consider commit-worthy at first, but then I suddenly had 250 scripts in ~/code
and almost 200 in ~/bin and *five* different Finger implementations...)

tl;dr I write a lot of useless scripts

    kc                  – manage Kerberos ticket caches
    kl                  – like 'klist' except better

The rest:

  bin/
    – contains symlinks to all scripts, for my $PATH
  dist/
    – scripts dealing with this repository itself
  obj/
    – compiled binaries for C tools, to allow sharing `~/code` over NFS
  misc/
    – stuff that will, some day, be cleaned up and put in the right place
